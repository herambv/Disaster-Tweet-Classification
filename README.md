# Disaster-Tweet-Classification
With a good accuracy of 80% this model aims to classify if the tweets made to create awareness of a disaster are real or not . I have used NLP to solve this issue and also compared different algorithms and their accuracy to get the best model.This project is done with python language and on Jupyter Notebook.
